Last month my team and I had a research project about machine learning for text analysis which includes sentiment analysis, topic classification, intent classification and named entity recognition. This research is more like a challenge for us due to our knowledge and experience regarding ML that close to zero, but we need to deliver MVP as soon as possible (3 weeks or so). Fortunately, even though itâ€™s not perfect, somehow we manage to build an API that fulfills 2 out of 4 features that I mentioned previously, which are topic classification and intent classification. In this article, I would like to share our experience on how someone new to machine learning can build fully functioning text classifier.
